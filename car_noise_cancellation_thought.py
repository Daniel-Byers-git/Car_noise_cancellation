# start of car noise cancellation repo

# ! Idea Board:

# * 1. Make small module with mic, speaker and inverting op-amp
    # This will read in mic audio and emit inverted audio to cancel
    # Learn feedback anc theory

# * 2. Feed audio to arduino to detect monotonous long standing frequencies
    # This will then modifiy an electrical component in the hardware ciruit to actively focus on emiiting those frequencies.
    # Learn what this circuit aspect will be. That filters frequencies. 

# * 3. Use op-amp in series with electrical filter 

# * 4. Replace modular speaker with Car Speakers
    # Wire in inverting op-amp to car speakers for use
